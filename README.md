#### SciPy 2016

We had such a great time at [SciPy 2016](http://scipy2016.scipy.org/ehome/index.php?eventid=146062&tabid=332930&) in Austin! It was a real pleasure to meet and chat with so many readers of my book. Thanks so much for all the nice words and feedback! And in case you missed it, Andreas Mueller and I gave an **Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-learn**; if you are interested, the video recordings of [Part I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB1reY6IX-o&index=91&list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6) and [Part II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cte8FYCpylk&list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6&index=90) are now online!

#### PyData Chicago 2016

I attempted the reather challenging task to give introduction to scikit-learn & machine learning in *just* 90 minutes at PyData Chicago 2016. The slides and tutorial material are available at "[Learning scikit-learn -- An Introduction to Machine Learning in Python](https://github.com/rasbt/pydata-chicago2016-ml-tutorial)."

**Note**

I have set up a separate library, [`mlxtend`](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/), containing additional implementations of machine learning (and general "data science") algorithms. I also added implementations from this book (for example, the decision region plot, the artificial neural network, and sequential feature selection algorithms) with additional functionality.

***Dear readers***,  
first of all, I want to thank all of you for the great support! I am really happy about all the great feedback you sent me so far, and I am glad that the book has been so useful to a broad audience.

Over the last couple of months, I received hundreds of emails, and I tried to answer as many as possible in the available time I have. To make them useful to other readers as well, I collected many of my answers in the FAQ section (below).

In addition, some of you asked me about a platform for readers to discuss the contents of the book. I hope that this would provide an opportunity for you to discuss and share your knowledge with other readers:

#### [Google Groups Discussion Board](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-machine-learning-reader-discussion-board)

(And I will try my best to answer questions myself if time allows! :))

## Examples and Applications by Readers

Once again, I have to say (big!) THANKS for all the nice feedback about the book. I've received many emails from readers, who
put the concepts and examples from this book out into the real world and make good use of them in their projects. In this section, I am
starting to gather some of these great applications, and I'd be more than happy to add your project to this list -- just shoot me a quick mail!
